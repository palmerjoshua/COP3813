Intro to Internet Computing homework assignments

This repository will contain each assignment I do in class,
which should consist of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP files.

Feel free to use my code however you want, but keep in mind:

1. There surely will be a better way to code these projects.
2. If you're a classmate and intend on using my code, my commit log 
   should be enough proof that these ideas are my own. 
   I am not responsible if you get caught cheating.
