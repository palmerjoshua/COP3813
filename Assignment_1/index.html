                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_York_%28guitarist%29" target="_blank">Andrew York</a> is a contemporary Classical guitarist. The songs he writes sound unmistakably modern, yet he incorporates the same Classical technique used for hundreds of years. My favorite of his solos is "Sunburst," which he plays in the second half of the video above. To hear it played without the "Jubilation" intro, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvmcNaMLYXs" target="_blank">here is a nearly perfect performance by virtuosa Li Jie</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_de_Luc%C3%ADa" target="_blank">Paco de Lucia</a> was one of the greatest <span>Flamenco</span> guitarists of his time. Flamenco guitar uses similar technique to Classical guitar, but the right-hand technique is slightly different. Flamenco guitars are constructed differently than standard Classical guitars, even though they look similar and both use nylon strings. Paco was a master of his art and one of the greatest soloists and improvisers who ever lived.</p>

                <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLaughlin_%28musician%29" target="_blank">John McLaughlin</a> and Paco de Lucia are a fasinating team because each player brings a different style and skillset to the performance. McLaughlin uses a more contemporary American technique, whereas de Lucia uses his traditional Flamenco technique. This song, "Spain," was written by legendary Jazz pianist Chick Corea. It is a Jazz standard with a heavy Hispanic influence, making it the perfect demonstration of the de Lucia/McLaughlin duo. </p>
